# 🏘️ Fannie Mae Stress Testing Visualizer
Ever wonder how stable our housing market is? See it for yourself! 👀
- Vary mortgage default rates for "normal" and "stressed" scenarios
- Choose how large your hypothetical holdings of fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) are
- Visualize the distribution of net or percentage returns of a hypothetical portfolio
- See how VaR, ES, volatility, skew, and kurtosis change for each scenario

An experiment 🔬 with using Spark to process a large dataset, using Fannie Mae documentation to understand mortgage reporting standards, and Python to run a Monte-Carlo simulation.
